# **The Metaverse**

## What is the Metaverse?

"Think Ready Player One, but more accessible and pragmatic" (1). The Metaverse has been a subject of focus for longer than many may realize. The beginnings started around 30 years ago in the early 90's but hadn't truly been possible until the last few years and even more so in the last 1-2 years, but we'll discuss that later. The Metaverse is a digital environment where people can interact with AR, VR and socialmedia integration. Think a digital escape from the real world where even more is possible. Imagine a world within a world, you get off work and toss on a headset and grab you controller much like normal, except this time you can go nearly where ever you want from within your own home.

## What Makes It Possible?

The Metaverse would rely upon several interlinking features & functions
- Augmented Reality
- Virtual Reality
- Crypto Currency
- Non-Fungable Tokens
- Omni-directional Treadmills

AR and VR give the user the means of entering the world and interacting with other users. This technology has grown by leaps and bounds over the last several years, the headsets have become lighter and more comfortable, the controls have become smoother in their response and far more affordable. Lastly with the improvements to the headsets, they've lessened the liklihood of nausea for users which is rather important if people plan to spend extended periods of time in the Metaverse. Another interesting tool that would add to the realism and more natural feeling of the metaverse would be an omnidirectional treadmill. A tool that i'd wager most people don't even know actually exists today, albeit not cheap. The idea changes from company to company and there are many that offer this treadmill or rather will once their designs each fruition (covid didn't help). Virtuix is in the process of designing one that follows the Ready Player One concept of a central stand keeping the player in place while allowing them to run, jump, walk and crouch all without bumping into things(6).

Crypto and NFTs argueably would be the final keys to the puzzle. Crypto provides the blockchain needed to keep peoples digital wallets safe and secure. This would be key in a digital world where everyone has their own in-metaverse currency, which would be requried to purchase in world content. NFTs would be the means of ownership in the Metaverse. NFTs are another means of digital ownership that also follows the blockchain that cryptocurrency uses. The benefit of the blockchain is the inability to forge items and the 100% accuracy of proof of ownership. This would prove to be the ultimate means of have digital metaverse content be it skins, weapons, upgrades, avatar items and of course as mentioned currency. Truly I feel if the Metaverse is going to work to the level of Ready Player One, NFTs and blockchains would be more than essential for its survival and the prevention of hackers creating their own fake content or duplicating content(2).

## Applications and Uses of the Metaverse

The things that can be done within the Metaverse are in some peoples minds, limitless, but when will this be the case? The initial applications will be highly dependent upon which company you're looking into and what their intentions are, perfect examples are the difference between FaceBook and Microsoft. FaceBook or Meta is interested in creating a hangout place, like a virtual house or hangout space a' la what FaceBook already is. Where as Microsoft is more interested in a virtual meeting place rather than a hangout area (2). There are some who already exists in some small manners, but not interconnected. Nearly any online environment is a mini-metaverse of sorts, World of Warcraft, FortNite and even Call of Duty to some degree.

Players or people get into lobbies with their custom gear, outfits, skins and goof off. FortNite throws concerts with legitimate artists and everyone gathers from all around the globe to be a part of it. Now imagine this on an even larger scale and you can instantly shift from a FortNite concert to a World of Warcraft type raid smoothly. Everyone has different ideas, but if it truly takes off and starts to scale up, there is no limit to how large the Metaverse could become. 

## Is It Truly Possible?

Now here is the real difficulty, can companies agree enough to allow their content to be more or less intermixed with other companies content? Will there be doors or worlds for each companies IP to be accessed without it being directly linked to anothers? Does each user need all of the accessories to be together? Who will regulate the content and rules? how would they be enforced? Would the metaverse be limited to each country or a global tool, because each country has different laws, rules and content they either allow or outright ban. There are a multitude of things that could prevent a full fledged metaverse.
